<p><strong>I'm a postdoctoral  fellow in Westlake University, China.  My research interests are algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, number theory and theoritical physics. You can find my <a href="files/Xuecai_CV.pdf" style ="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">CV</a> and
		 <a href="files/Xuecai_Research.pdf" style ="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">Research Statement</a> here.  Currently, I focus on  the following  problems.</strong></p>	
      <ul>
        <li><p>Derive algebraic geometry methods in algebraic topology and number theory, especially derived moduli spaces, derived rings.</p></li>
	<li><p>Derived rings and p-adic cohomology theories, like topological Hochschild homology, prismatic cohomology. </p></li>
        <li><p>Stolz-Teichner program, which gives a relation between quantum field theories and generalized cohomology theories.</p>  </li>
        <li><p>The relation between spectral algebraic geometry and absolute algebraic geometry.</p>  </li>
     </ul>
