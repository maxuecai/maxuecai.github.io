# About Me
---
		
I'm a postdoctoral  fellow in Westlake University, China.  My research interests are algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, number theory and theoritical physics. You can find my [CV](files/Xuecai_CV.pdf) and
[Research Statement](files/Xuecai_Research.pdf) here.  Currently, I focus on  the following  problems.</strong></p>	
1. Derive algebraic geometry methods in algebraic topology and number theory, especially derived moduli spaces, derived rings.
2. Derived rings and p-adic cohomology theories, like topological Hochschild homology, prismatic cohomology. 
3. Stolz-Teichner program, which gives a relation between quantum field theories and generalized cohomology theories.
4. The relation between spectral algebraic geometry and absolute algebraic geometry.
