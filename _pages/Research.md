My research interests are algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, number theory and theoritical physics. Currently, I focus on the following problems.
1. Derive algebraic geometry methods in algebraic topology and number theory, especially derived moduli spaces, derived rings.
2. Derived rings and p-adic cohomology theories, like topological Hochschild homology, prismatic cohomology.
3. Stolz-Teichner program, which gives a relation between quantum field theories and generalized cohomology theories.
4. The relation between spectral algebraic geometry and absolute algebraic geometry.
